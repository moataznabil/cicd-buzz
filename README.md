A way to ship code in small increments and iterations is by using a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, or CI/CD, pipeline.

From start to end this tutorial shows you in 9 steps how to:

1- Write a little Python program (not Hello World)

2- Add some automated tests for the program

3- Push your code to GitHub

4- Setup Travis CI to continuously run your automated tests

5- Setup Better Code Hub to continuously check your code quality

6- Turn the Python program into a web app

7- Create a Docker image for the web app

8- Push the Docker image to Docker Hub

9- Deploy the Docker image to Heroku
